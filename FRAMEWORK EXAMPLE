As the project manager, I must be very organised, which means I must stick to my own schedules, and also the teams schedule. Along the way I must also keep my progression and work in writing to show as evidence of the work that is being done. 

As for my reporting, it will be done via a personal journal. This journal will be updated every time there is work done which is worth reporting, I may not be doing work on a daily basis (weekends for example) therefor it will not be a daily journal, but rather one that gets updated often and frequently depending on what needs done and what work has been implemented. This is a way to express my thinking and how I came up with the ideas that I did, also it helps me reflect on the decisions I made earlier in the project which will help me going forward. 

Secondly, I will be creating a reflective report, which I will start closer to the end of the project, and I will be looking closely at my journal to include key points. This report will consist of how the project went, the planning and thinking behind the project, and everyoneâ€™s roles and how they contributed towards the project and the end goal. It will also include what things we would have changed looking back and what aspects did not go so well. We are human after all and some mistakes will more than likely be made along the way.
